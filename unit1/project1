  <h1>ODESZA EQUAL PARTS AMBITIOUS AND AUDACIOUS</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
<P>Now, with its fourth album complete, ODESZA is poised to present its most lofty live show to date during a 27-date North American run, launching July 29 with three sold-out hometown shows at the 17,459-seat Climate Pledge Arena. The remainder of the tour will hit mostly amphitheaters, venues that — outside of Colorado’s Red Rocks, a standard stop for A-list dance producers — <b>have never </b>been the domain of electronic acts.</P>

  <h4>US duo Odesza are proving the genre is about more than auto-tune and overpaid DJs.</h4>
  
  <p>Odesza, a duo comprising of Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight, are well known for their musical masterpieces that can be described as atmospheric and emotional. Their signature sound often includes heavy drums and percussion, laced over synths</p>
  Mills and Knight are tight-lipped about what they’re assembling for the tour, assuring only that the set will include visuals by longtime live director Luke Tanaka and creative director Sean Kusanagi. They estimate the outing will require 11 semitrucks and a crew of 100, and let it slip that the drumline is returning.
